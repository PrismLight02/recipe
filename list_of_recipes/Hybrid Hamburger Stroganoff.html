        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p>I created this hamburger stroganoff as an amalgamation of about a half-dozen stroganoff recipes. 
            Really hits the spot on a cold day, served over egg noodles with peas and carrot</p>
        <ul> <h4>Recipe</h4>
            <li> 1 pound lean ground beef </li>
            <li> 1 (8 ounce) package sliced white mushrooms </li>
            <li> 1 onion, chopped </li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li> 1 cup red wine </li>
            <li> 1 cup beef stock </li>
            <li> 1 cup sour cream </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h5>Step 1</h5>
                <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef, mushrooms, and onion. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and discard grease. Transfer mixture to a bowl. Add garlic and oil to the skillet; saute until garlic is golden brown, about 1 minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Step 2</h5>
                <p>Turn skillet heat to high; add red wine and beef stock. Bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.
                    Reduce heat and simmer until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Step 3</h5>
                <p>Whisk sour cream and cornstarch together in a bowl. Mix into the wine/broth mixture. 
                Stir in the browned beef mixture. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Add salt and pepper.</p>
